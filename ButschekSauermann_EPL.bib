	abstract = {To estimate the causal effect of employment protection on firms{\textquoteright} worker selection, we study a policy change that reduced dismissal costs for the employers of more than a tenth of Sweden{\textquoteright}s workforce. Our difference-in-differences analysis of firms{\textquoteright} hiring uses individual ability measures, including estimated worker fixed effects, GPA at age 15, and military test scores. We find that the reform reduced minimum hire quality by around 2 percent. Our results show that firms both decreased their hiring thresholds and hired more workers. We find that firms increasingly hired young, foreign-born, and long-term nonemployed individuals, suggesting potential welfare gains from the reform.},
